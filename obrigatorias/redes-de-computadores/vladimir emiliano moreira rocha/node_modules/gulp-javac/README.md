# gulp-javac

Compile java source and create jars from gulp.

***Notice:*** Source is being migrated to a new repository and is
temporarily unavailable.

## Install

    $ npm install --save-dev gulp-javac

## Usage

```js
javac = require('gulp-javac');

gulp.task('example', function() {
  return gulp.src('./src/**/*.java')
    .pipe(javac('example.jar')
            .addLibraries('./lib/**/*.jar')
            .addLibraries('./external/**/*.jar'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('out'));
});
```

## API

### javac.javac([options])

Returns: Duplex Stream (`<java source files>` ---> `<class files>`)

Compiles source into a set of .class files. Input files are expected to be
java source files; directories are ignored.  Produces a stream of generated
files.

#### options
  
##### debuggingInformation

Type: `string` or `string[]`  
Default: `['lines', 'source']`

Sets the debugging information output to the class files. Valid values are
`'lines'`, `'source'`, and `'vars'`. Set this to `'none'`, `null` (or something
false-y) to not include any debugging information. Set this to `'*'` to include
all debugging information.

##### javaVersion

Type: `string`  
Default: *System default*

Sets the Java language version to use.  Example: `'1.7'`

##### failOnWarning

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `false`

Set to `true` for compilation to fail on compiler warnings.

##### noWarnings

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `false`

Set to `true` to not output compiler warnings.

##### javacToolPath

Type: `string`  
Default: *javac on $PATH*

Path to the javac compiler. If `javac` isn't on your $PATH, set this to the path.

##### verbose

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `false`

Set to `true` to include verbose javac output.

##### javacCompilerFlags

Type: `string[]`  
Default: `[]`

Flags to pass to the underlying javac runner.  See the `-J` flag in `man javac`.

##### traceEnabled

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `undefined` *(Uses module settings)*

Sets tracing for this particular step. This overrides the module-level setting.

#### addLibraries(...sources)

Returns: javac object

Adds libraries to the classpath for compilation against. This returns the
javac object that it was called on so that calls can be chained.

##### sources

***Required***  
Type: `string` or `string[]` or readable stream of vinyl files

Libraries to add. If this is a `string` or `string[]` it is treated as a
glob spec and all files are added. Otherwise all files on the stream are
added.  The following are all equivalent:

```js
javac().addLibraries('./a/**/*').addLibraries('./b/**/*');
javac().addLibraries('./a/**/*', './b/**/*');
javac().addLibraries(['./a/**/*', './b/**/*']);
javac().addLibraries(gulp.src('./a/**/*'), gulp.src('./b/**/*'));
javac().addLibraries(gulp.src(['./a/**/*', './b/**/*']));
```

### javac.jar(jarName, [options])

Returns: Duplex Stream (`<class files>` ---> `<jar file>`)

Builds a jar file from provided sources.  Expects a stream of jar contents
and will use relative paths for jar contents.  Produces a stream with just
the resulting jar.

**Note:** The jar command will ***not*** repackage other jars. If other jars
are included in the sources, those jars will be embedded within the created
jar, which probably isn't what you want. If you want to repackage jars, you
can try the following recipe:

```js
const merge = require('merge-stream');

merge(
    gulp.src('./src/**/*.java')
      .pipe(javac.javac()
            .addLibraries('./lib/**/*.jar')),
    gulp.src('./lib/**/*.jar')
      .pipe(javac.unjar()))
  .pipe(jar('example.jar'));
```

This is likely to fail if there are collisions. In this case you'll probably
have to use other tools, like [Jar Jar Links](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jarjar/)
or [ProGuard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/).

#### jarName

*Required*
Base name of the jar file to create.

#### options
  
##### omitManifest

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `false`

Use `true` to direct the jar tool to not create a manifest.

##### entryPoint

Type: `string`  
Default: `undefined`

Set this to the full class name of the class to use when running the jar from the
command line.

##### jarToolPath

Type: `string`  
Default: *jar on $PATH*

Path to the jar tool. If `jar` isn't on your $PATH, set this to the path.

##### verbose

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `false`

Set to `true` to include verbose jar output.

##### traceEnabled

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `undefined` *(Uses module settings)*

Sets tracing for this particular step. This overrides the module-level setting.

##### jarCompilerFlags

Type: `string[]`  
Default: `[]`

Flags to pass to the underlying jar runner.  See the `-J` flag in `man jar`.

### javac.unjar([options])

Returns: Duplex Stream (`<jar files>` ---> `<jar contents>`)

Extracts files from a jar. Expects a stream of jar files. Produces a stream
of the jar contents. By default this will only include `.class` files, but
can be expanded to all files by using the `includeAllFiles` option.

#### options
  
##### jarToolPath

Type: `string`
Default: *jar on $PATH*

Path to the jar tool. If `jar` isn't on your $PATH, set this to the path.

##### includeAllFiles

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Set to `true` to include all jar contents. Otherwise only `.class` files will
be included.

##### verbose

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Set to `true` to include verbose jar output.

##### traceEnabled

Type: `boolean`
Default: `undefined` *(Uses module settings)*

Sets tracing for this particular step. This overrides the module-level setting.

### javac(jarName, [options])

Returns: Duplex Stream (`<java source files>` ---> `<jar file>`)

Convenience function for running both javac.javac(...) and javac.jar(...). These
are equivalent:

```js
// Options.
let javacOptions = {...},
    jarOptions = {...},
    jarName = '...';

let mergedOptions = require('underscore')
  .extend({}, javacOptions, jarOptions);

// Manual method:
gulp.src(...)
  .pipe(javac.javac(mergedOptions).addLibraries(...))
  .pipe(javac.jar(jarName, mergedOptions));

// Merged method:
gulp.src(...)
  .pipe(javac(jarName, mergedOptions).addLibraries(...));
```

The only overlapping options are `verbose` and `traceEnabled`.  `jarName` is
passed to `jar()` and `options` is passed to both `javac` and `jar`.  The
`addLibraries()` method is passed to `javac`, but the return object is this
stream to allow chaining.

### trace

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `false`

Module-level flag for tracing. Set to `true` to enable trace output. This is useful
when trying to diagnose a problem with compilation, or when developing the library.

This can be enabled per-run by passing a `--gulp-javac.trace` flag to `gulp`.
